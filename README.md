# SNAKE.6502_JOHNNWFS
SNAKE for Commander X16 emulator v33
WRITTEN ON VISUAL STUDIO CODE
USING RETRO ASSEMBLER https://enginedesigns.net/post/2017/07/retro-assembler/

There are a quite a number of methods I've used that I've since realized could be optimized
My current plan is to add far more comments for what's in the assembly and to add a few 
features. Hit me up at either @JohnNWFS on Twitter or JohnHoffer on Facebook if you'd 
like to discuss the program!
